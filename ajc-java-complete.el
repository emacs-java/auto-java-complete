;;{{{ Commentary

;;;this is "Auto Java Complete".

;;1. it depends on auto complete ,so it would complete
;;   everything by dropdowning a menu.

;;2. it is tag based . so before you used it on emacs ,you
;;   should generate a tag file by using Tags.java .
;;   about how to use it ,see the Install section.

;;3. it depends on yasnippet . when completing method and
;;   constructor it would generate a templete dynamically
;;   so that you can jump from a paramter to another one .

;;4. when completing method ,it can show return type behind
;;   each candidate on dropdown menu.
;;   I want to show
;;       toString() :String         on menu ,but just insert
;;       toString()                 in buffer ,
;;   but there is a problem:
;;   auto complete 1.3 now doesn't support it .
;;   I patched  popup.el in auto-complete-1.3/  ,
;;   the patched file is ajc-java-complete/popup.el, please
;;   put this file into auto-complete-1.3/ ,or use
;;      ajc-java-complete/popup-patch.diff
;;      cp  ajc-java-complete/popup-patch.diff auto-complete-1.3/
;;      cd auto-complete-1.3/
;;      patch -p0 < popup-patch.diff
;;
;;     don't forget to byte-compile it

;;{{{ Features

;; 1. support importing.
;;    when you type in  import javax.s-|-
;;    it would drop down a menu like this
;;             import  javax.s
;;
;;                     javax.sql
;;                     javax.swing
;;                     javax.sound
                       
;; 2. support import class with keybindings (even in jsp file)
;;         auto import all Class in source file
;;    (local-set-key (kbd "C-c i") (quote ajc-import-all-unimported-class))
;;         import Class where under point 
;;    (local-set-key (kbd "C-c m") (quote ajc-import-class-under-point))
;;   included in ajc-complete-config.el

;; 3. support completing class name ,you just need  typing
;;    in a Word beginning with [A-Z] ,then it would auto find
;;    matched class and list it with dropdown menu.


;; 4. support complete method.
;;    for example
;;    List<Map<String,Object>> list = new ArrayList<Map<String,Object>>();
;;         list.

;;    it would list all method like this
;;         list.
;;              equals(Object)
;;              add(Object)
;;              clear()

;;    it can do more
;;         list.listIterator().next().
;;                                      toString()
;;                                      getClass()
;;                                      notify()
                                      
;; 5. support complete constructor
;;    after keyword 'new' it would try to complete constructor


;; 6. support completing in jsp files.
      
;;    If your want to enable  ajc-java-complete-mode when openning
;;    a jsp file. you can
;;        (add-hook 'jsp-mode 'ajc-java-complete-mode)
;;    if you has a jsp-mode;
;;    if not ,you can do it like this
;;        (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'ajc-4-jsp-find-file-hook)
      
;;    now it can complete class name,method ,constructor.
;;    it also support complete importing ,but it isn't auto completed,
;;    you must trigger it by a key binding
;;    for example (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-1") 'auto-complete)
;;    <%@ page language="java" import="java.io.File,java.util.Map,javax.sw-|-"%>
;;    now you can  press M-1 to show the menu.
